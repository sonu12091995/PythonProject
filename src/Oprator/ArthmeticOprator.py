# Arithmetic operators

a = 5
b = 2

print(a + b)   # addition of a, b
print(a - b)   # subtraction
print(a * b)   # multiplication
print(a / b)   # division (returns float)
print(a // b)  # floor division (quotient)
print(a % b)   # modulus (remainder)
print(a ** b)  # exponentiation (a raised to b)
